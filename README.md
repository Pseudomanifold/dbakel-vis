# dbakel-vis

This repository is an attempt at visualising the 'debacle' that is the
German railway system at the moment. Based on a [recent report by the
German Government](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/102/2010284.pdf)
as an answer to the conservative opposition party, a list of the status
of several objects of the German railway system was provided.

The report is quite long (and preserved in the `raw` folder) and
contains a lot of tables, making the parsing process quite hard. I wrote
some code to extract said tables and visualise them---please find the
results below.
